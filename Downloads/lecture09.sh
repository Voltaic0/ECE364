# ####################

# cat - Concatenate and Print Files to stdout

cat -eT languages1.txt      # display fileA's contents, including invisible (tab/newline) characters
cat fileA fileB fileC       # display the contents of the files in order.
cat *.txt                   # display all files that end in .txt, in order.

# head and tail - Print the Start and End of Files
head -n 5 languages1.txt    # print the first 5 lines of fileA
head -c 5 languages1.txt    # print the first 5 characters of fileA

# egrep - Regular Expression Text Search.
# search through the 'contents' of files and directories.
egrep "foo" languages2.txt  # display all lines that match "foo" in file to the console
egrep "^X" *.txt            # display all lines that match the regex "^H" in files.
egrep -lr "foo" dirA        # display all files in directory dirA that contain the word "foo"
                            # -l stands for list-files, and -r stands for recursive

# cut - Select Sections of a File: select entire columns of tabulated data files.

# sort - Sort a File
sort fileA                  # print fileA with its lines sorted alphabetically.

# wc - Word Count

# Variables:
# All variables and values are by default processed as text strings.
# ####################

# Assignment and Usage
myvar="Hello  World"        # myvar now contains the text "Hello World" (no quotes) 
mynum=5                     # mynum now contains the character '5' (no quotes) 
mylongnum=364               # mylongnum now contains the string "364" (no quotes)

# WARNING: Spaces matter.
# This WILL NOT WORK: No spaces before or after the "="
# brokenvar = Some text
correctvar="Some Text"      # If the text string value contains spaces.

# To use a variable's value, the variable name must be preceded by a '$' sign
echo $myvar                 # display Hello World in the console
echo "$mynum + $mylongnum"    # display the text: 5 + 364

# Expression (subshell)
# ####################

# It is often useful to store a commandâ€™s output in a variable for use later. 
# In such cases, we create a subshell, a child process of the calling terminal that act like a terminals itself. 
# You can add any code you want to a subshell and its output will be sent back out to the calling shell (bash process)
ls *.txt > list_of_files.txt   # See below for I/O Redirection.
myfiles=$(cat list_of_files.txt)
# * The file "list_of_files.txt" contains filenames that we may want to use later.
# * the $() notation creates a subshell, and runs any code given inside it.
# * its output is sent back out to our calling statement.
# * In this case, it will store it in a variable.

echo  $myfiles              
# $myfiles now includes the text from list_of_files.txt

mv $myfiles $someFolder     # that variable can then be used like any other in commands
ls $someFolder

somefiles=$(egrep lr "ee364[a-g][0-9]{2}") # list all files that contain ee364 IDs

# IO Redirection: redirect one command's output into a file or even another command's input
# ####################
# > - Write Output to File
echo "Hello World" > fileA    # Writes "Hello World" to fileA.
echo "foo bar" >> fileA       # Appends to fileA.
ls *.txt > list_of_files.txt  # You get the idea!

# |- Pipe Output to Another Command's Input.
# Return a list of all files matching the pattern in the regex
ls -l | egrep "file[A-Za-z][0-9].csv" 

cat regexlines.txt | egrep -f - fileToSearch.txt
echo "ee364[a-g][0-9]\{2\}" | egrep -f - fileToSearch.txt
# * The -f switch to use a file as its regex input
# * RegEx will search for the contents of that file in other files. 
# * The file which we will use to input is stdin (specified by the dash '-' character above).
# * This lets us input regex to egrep from the pipe. 
# * If regexlines.txt contains more than one line, egrep will run multiple times 
#   using each line of the file as a regex pattern.
# Play  around  with  the  above concepts to familiarize yourself with grep's more powerful features. 

# This can be combined with subshells and variables: 
pattern="file[A-Za-z][0-9].csv"
